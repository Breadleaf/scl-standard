# Simple Config Language

## Why

I made this language to be extremely easy to parse with an extremely minimal syntax.
Of course with these limitations this language is not the best to model all problems,
and thats ok. I wrote this language for the soul purpose of being as readable as
possible. In fact, its so simple there are only two explicit syntax elements; which
you can read more about in the docs (linked below).

Also I know many will refer to the following comic from xkcd; so I beat you all to it.
Now there is no need to send it to me!
