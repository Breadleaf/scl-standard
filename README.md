# Simple Config Language

## Disclaimer

It is worth noting that this project mught not suit your project. If you need to model complex relationships I highly reccomend an alternative. This project is best used for small configuration jobs such as cli applications that allow for defining colors or styles.

## Why

I made this language to be extremely easy to parse with an extremely minimal syntax. Of course with these limitations this language is not the best to model all problems, and thats ok. I wrote this language for the soul purpose of being as readable as possible. In fact, its so simple there are only three explicit syntax elements; which you can read more about in the docs (linked below).

Also I know many will refer to the following comic from xkcd; so I beat you all to it.
Now there is no need to send it to me!

It is worth noting that the examples are less practical, they are to show some extreme use cases.
